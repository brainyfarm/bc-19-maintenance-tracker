- Install [Bower](https://bower.io/) to manage front-end dependencies.

> Run `npm install -g bower`.

- Install [Sequelize-CLI](https://github.com/sequelize/cli) tool to help manage database migrations. 
> Run `npm install -g sequelize-cli`.

- Install [Jake](https://github.com/jakejs/jake) JavaScript build tool, similar to Make or Rake for Ruby. Used to create the Database for development.
> Run `npm install -g jake`.

## Local development.

1. Clone this repository locally by running

> `git clone https://github.com/azemoh/bc-19-maintenance-tracker.git`

2. Navigate into the project folder `cd bc-19-maintenance-tracker`.

3. Install required nodejs packages by running
> `npm install`

4. Install Front-end libraries with __bower__
